# Let's first add here ~5k words:
#   - length does not matter here - a word might be too long for English list, but it might be appropriate for other lists,
#   - common nouns and adjectives known to everyone, without using US or GB specific words,
#   - it does not matter that some words might be less known in some of the countries (for example animals or fruits),
#   - hopefully grouping them by category will help; let's keep order (may be simply alphabetical) within each such group;
#     feel free to add more groups.
