## Abstract

WLIP-0001 standardizes requirements for word lists. As it is not possible to create just one set of requirements 
applicable to all possible languages, more than one set of requirements is provided.

## Motivation

Different word lists - the ones already proposed and those yet to be created, are created by different authors,
with different objectives in mind. There is no common denominator.

## Requirements description

It is not possible to come up with just one set of requirements for all languages.
However, various languages might be grouped based on character set they use/they slightly modify.
Based on such character sets one can define requirements. We define following character sets:
1. English
2. Cyrillic
3. Hebrew
4. **Other character sets - help needed.**

Requirements for English/Cyrillic group.

1. **Character set.** All characters from the language are allowed. However, when applying rules no. 4 and 5,
only characters from English set should be used. In other words - letters with and without diacritics should be treated
equally.
Polish example,'ą' would be treated as 'a' resulting in "kąt" being treated as "kat".
2. **Word length.** Upper bound should be 8, due to the displays limited to 8 characters.
It also helps to keep full words (not only 4 first letters) in the steel backups. Lower bound set to 4 characters seems
to be nicely aligned with other constraints.
3. **The list consists of 2048 words and is sorted.**
4. **Smart selection of words.** The first 4 letters uniquely determine a word. This is really helpful when going
through the process of recovering the password, having hardware wallet with two buttons only. The lower bound, due to the number of characters
in an alphabet seems to be 3, but it will most likely be not possible to achieve. Especially having in mind other
constraints.
5. **Similar words avoided.** To be more precise, Levenshtein distance of ONE should not be allowed.
6. **Common nouns/adjectives only.** Plural form used only when there is no singular form/singular form is rarely used
7. **All words should be manually selected:**
   - Usage of words from [preliminary word list](wlip-0003/preliminary-word-lists/english_us) is highly encouraged 
   - They should come from some kind of widely accepted source (well known dictionaries)
   - it is OK if some people especially children would not understand some of them,
  but it should not 'put in trouble' (no embarrassing words) people who know the meaning and are asked for explanation.
  This is a vague definition but there really is no point to try to better define such groups. When in doubt, please
  simply come up with another word.

Requirements for Hebrew.
1. **Character set.** Character set should include only the 22 Hebrew letters and the 5 final forms. Geresh-modified letters as ג' ז' צ' are not included nor is the geresh (') iteslf. Words normally written with such letters should be avoided.
2. **Final letter forms.** All comparison operators checking for uniquness of words, uniquness of first k letters, edit distance, etc., should first normalize final forms into normal forms to consider the two forms as the same letter.
3. **Sorting.** Both character set and word list should use the standard lexicographic order placing final letter forms before their normal forms.
4. **Writing standand and full-spelling forms.** One should adhere to the latest Academy of The Hebrew Language standard. Most prominantly words should follow the [Missing vocalization spelling](https://hebrew-academy.org.il/topic/hahlatot/missingvocalizationspelling) full-spelling form (כללי הכתיב המלא) of 2017. Please note that most dictionaries and spell checkers are either not fully updated or allow mixed forms. Therefore word should be checked in the Academy's [website](https://hebrew-academy.org.il) search and consider the form without diacritics. Also note that most words of Aramaic origin ending with א are written with ה instead (דוגמה, קופסה etc) 
5. **Common nouns/adjectives.** As many Hebrew words can be read in multiple ways please consider noun/adjectives which do not have identical forms to common verbs or other parts of speech. Having only nouns and adjectives minimizes the security hazard of one trying to compose sentences out of the wordlist. 
6. **No prefixes.** Words should not use the משה וכלב preposition prefixes
7. **Unique first 3/4 letters**. Either the first 4 or first 3 letters should be unique among words (after normalizing final forms). In Hebrew 3 letter uniquenss is easily achivable at a price of having less common words. This tradeoff should be considered.
8. **Similar words avoided.** Require a Levenshtein distance > 1 (after normalizing final forms). As Hebrew grammer makes use of transpositions, consider using the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Avoid different infilctions of the same root. Avoid confusing word pairs due to homographs (eg ו\ן), homophones (eg ח\כ), added matres lectionis (אהוי), etc.
9. **Inflictions.** prefer basic forms but allow simple infilictions to make words more distinct and to represent both grammatical genders.
10. **Encoding**. UTF-8
11. Where not specified otherwise follow English guidelines above.

**Requirements for other character sets - help needed**
