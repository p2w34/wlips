## Abstract

WLIP-0001 standardizes requirements for word lists. As it is not possible to create just one set of requirements 
applicable to all possible languages, more than one set of requirements is provided.

## Motivation

Different word lists - the ones already proposed and those yet to be created, are created by different authors,
with different objectives in mind. There is no common denominator.

## Requirements description

It is not possible to come up with just one set of requirements for all languages.
However, various languages might be grouped based on character set they use/they slightly modify.
Based on such character sets one can define requirements. We define following character sets:
1. English
2. Cyrillic
3. **Other character sets - help needed.**

Requirements for English/Cyrillic group.

1. **Character set.** All characters from the language are allowed. However, when applying rules no. 4 and 5,
only characters from English set should be used. In other words - letters with and without diacritics should be treated
equally.
Polish example,'ą' would be treated as 'a' resulting in "kąt" being treated as "kat".
2. **Word length.** Upper bound should be 8, due to the displays limited to 8 characters.
It also helps to keep full words (not only 4 first letters) in the steel backups. Lower bound set to 4 characters seems
to be nicely aligned with other constraints.
3. **The list consists of 2048 words and is sorted.**
4. **Smart selection of words.** The first 4 letters uniquely determine a word. This is really helpful when going
through the process of recovering the password, having hardware wallet with two buttons only. The lower bound, due to the number of characters
in an alphabet seems to be 3, but it will most likely be not possible to achieve. Especially having in mind other
constraints.
5. **Similar words avoided.** To be more precise, Levenshtein distance of ONE should not be allowed.
6. **Common nouns/adjectives only.** Plural form used only when there is no singular form/singular form is rarely used
7. **All words should be manually selected:**
   - Usage of words from [preliminary word list](./preliminary-word-list) is highly encouraged 
   - They should come from some kind of widely accepted source (well known dictionaries)
   - it is OK if some people especially children would not understand some of them,
  but it should not 'put in trouble' (no embarrassing words) people who know the meaning and are asked for explanation.
  This is a vague definition but there really is no point to try to better define such groups. When in doubt, please
  simply come up with another word.

**Requirements for other character sets - help needed**
