# Contribution FAQ

Currently this repository is still in it's infancy.
Contributors are asked to focus on extending [preliminary word list](wlip-0003/english_us/preliminary-word-list).
Let's first add ~5k words:
  - length does not matter here - a word might be too long for English list, but it might be appropriate for other lists,
  - common nouns and adjectives known to everyone,
  - it does not matter that some words might be less known in some of the countries (for example animals or fruits),
  - hopefully grouping them by category will help; let's keep order (may be simply alphabetical) within each such group;
    feel free to add more groups.

Preliminary word list creation is a prerequisite to start work on the word lists.
